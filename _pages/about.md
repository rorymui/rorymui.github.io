<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently serving as a principal research fellow at the iFLYTEK Security Laboratory. I hold a Ph.D. in Cybersecurity and several international certifications, including CISSP, CCSP, CISA, and CDPSE. My research interests span cybersecurity, system security, and AI security, with a particular emphasis on building secure and trustworthy AI systems ‚Äî especially LLMs ‚Äî as well as exploring the applications of AI in cybersecurity and advancing system security technologies.

Throughout my career, I have led and contributed to a range of academic research projects and enterprise-driven initiatives in cyberspace and system security. My work has encompassed malware analysis, intrusion detection, secure software development, and vulnerability assessment. In recent years, my focus has shifted toward the security evaluation of large AI models, addressing challenges such as adversarial robustness, model alignment, and content compliance in AIGC.
